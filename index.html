The dove returned with an olive branch in its beak, signalling that the flood was receding. In a Greek myth, a dove was sent by the Argonauts to fly through the Moving Rocks at the Black Sea. The Rocks were said to crush the first living thing that came between them. The dove flew through with such speed that the Rocks crashed against each other, leaving the bird unharmed. The Argonauts had thereby ensured their safe passage ahead. </span>

        <span class="intro">Also known as the Dog Star, Sirius lies in the constellation Canis Major (the Greater Dog), and is the brightest star in the night sky. Ancient Egyptians identified Sirius with Isis — the Goddess of Fertility, the new year and the flood. Each year just before the summer solstice, Sirius would reappear in the sky after being absent for seventy days. This coincided with the flooding of the Nile river, which brought fertility to the land. Because of its seventy day absence, Sirius was also seen as the doorway to the afterlife. </span>

        <span class="intro">The Charioteer is said to be Erichthonius, the legendary King of Athens.

        <span class="intro">Made of ice, dust and rock particles, Halley’s Comet is named after Edmond Halley, who concluded that the comets of 1531, 1607 and 1682 were the same one. He also predicted the next time it will appear, but did not live to see it come true. Halley’s Comet is seen from Earth once every 75 years as it orbits the Sun.

        <h2>XV - Cetus (The Sea Monster)</h2>
        <span class="intro">Greek mythology tells of Queen Cassiopeia, who boasted that she and her daughter Andromeda were more beautiful than the daughters of Poseidon. To punish Cassiopeia for her arrogance, Poseidon sent floods on her lands. Cassiopeia consulted the Oracle to find out how to appease the god, and was told that she had to sacrifice her daughter to the sea monster Cetus, who lived in Poseidon’s ocean.

        <div class="message"><span class="bold">Message: </span><span>Fear, materialism, lust. Ignorance. Self-imposed bonds. Cetus comes from the sea — symbolic of the unconscious, and was defeated by coming to the surface — the conscious, rational mind.

        <h2>XVIII - The Moon</h2>
        <span class="intro">The Moon is the Earth’s only satellite. Lighting the way at night, it reflects the rays of the Sun but does not emit any light of its own—this is its power of illusion. The change of phases throughout the month have given the Moon a strong association with women, intuition, and the unconscious. </span>
        <div class="message"><span class="bold">Message: </span><span>Mysterious and elusive, the Moon asks us to look beyond the illusion. Something is not as it seems. Confusion, deception.
